Hi Lukas,Â 

Big fan of Half life here! not so much DoTA though. Just saw your msg for CV engineers and had a question, I have a strong expertise in 3D vision and SLAM related algos but not so much in human subject awareness, is that a breaking constraint for the role? 

I do have an 4 years of background as senior C++ dev (low latency @ fintech) and really good internships at Bell labs and Torc Robotics and many cool projects like NeRFs etc . my resume (saikrn112.github.io/CV.pdf)
