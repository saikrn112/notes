individual things are good but ordering is missing
- I need to change the ordering here 
- he doesnt know what I am doing or at least he is not getting that context
- so I need to somehow explain that 
I can something like we have a bee and we want to 

ideas 
	- bee for pollination
	- drone surveillance 
	- **vertical farming**

```
Sure, here's a brief story you can use to sell the idea of using small drones with optical flow sensors for vertical farming:

Slide 1: The Problem

-   Traditional farming methods are inefficient and often lead to crop losses due to pests, disease, or weather conditions.
-   Vertical farming provides a solution, but monitoring and maintaining crops can be challenging, especially in large-scale operations.

Slide 2: The Solution

-   Small drones equipped with optical flow sensors can revolutionize the field of vertical farming, by providing a more efficient and effective way to monitor and maintain crops.
-   By using optical flow for navigation, drones can fly precisely through the layers of crops, detecting issues such as nutrient deficiencies, pests, or disease in real-time.
-   Drones can also apply treatments such as fertilizers or pesticides, reducing the need for human intervention and improving the accuracy of application.

Slide 3: The Benefits

-   By using small drones with optical flow sensors for vertical farming, farmers can increase efficiency, reduce costs, and improve crop yields.
-   Drones provide real-time data on crop health and allow for more precise and targeted treatments, leading to a more sustainable source of food for the growing global population.
-   Overall, small drones equipped with optical flow sensors have the potential to revolutionize the field of vertical farming, providing a more efficient and sustainable solution for feeding the world.
