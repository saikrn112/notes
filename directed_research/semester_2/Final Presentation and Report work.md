The model also includes a unified 2D/3D anchor design and an auxiliary task to detect 2D/3D lanes simultaneously, improving feature consistency and sharing the benefits of multi-task learning. The authors also released a new large-scale real-world 3D lane dataset called OpenLane, with high-quality annotations and scenario diversity, to encourage the development of lane detection and autonomous driving methods. PersFormer outperforms competitive baselines in the 3D lane detection task on both the OpenLane dataset and the Apollo 3D Lane Synthetic dataset, and performs on par with state-of-the-art algorithms in the 2D task on OpenLane.
