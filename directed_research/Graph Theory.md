##### BiPartite Graph

^aa9606

a graph whose vertices can be divided into 2 _disjoint_ and _independent_ sets $U$ and $V$ .i.e every edge in the set connects an element from $U$ to one in $V$

>[!question]
>what are disjoint sets? 
> - 2 sets are disjoint if they have no element in common
>
>what are independent sets?
> - in graph theory, an independent set is a set of vertices in a graph such that no two elements are adjacent, (i.e no connection or edge exists between the elements in this sets)

##### Matching
_Graph Theory Definition_: 
- is a set of edges without common vertices in an undirected graph
> what do they mean by common vertices? 
> 	essentially the nodes to which edges are connected are not present in the set
> why would anyone what to do this formulation? 
> 	I think this is more useful 

- finding matching in bipartite graph[[#^aa9606]] is a network flow problem
- Maximum matching -- maximum cardinality matching -- 
>cardinality of a set - measure of "number of elements"
>	but it's not related to the above problem


Related to graph theory is the optimal transport problem of matching
