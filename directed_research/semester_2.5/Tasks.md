## Backlog

- [ ] Task: test the trained Multiscale + uncertainty
- [ ] Task: check if edge detection has been overfit by running tests
- [ ] Task: review existing pretrained model on sintel to compare numbers with my script and paper<br>- [ ] impl RAFT evaluation to make sure numbers are correct
- [ ] print different loss components now
- [ ] Idea: UNet
- [ ] Idea: UNet with Multiscale
- [ ] Idea: Unet + Uncertainity
- [ ] Idea: UNet + multiscale + uncertainty
- [ ] Review: Focal Loss vs Detail Loss
- [ ] Idea: Nanoflownet based MB impl
- [ ] read nanoflownet again but this time for references
- [ ] some paper on consolidated methods for speed of the network


## Progress

- [ ] Task: get 450 Epoch finetuned model from Aniket, Mandeep and Prof Nitin


## training



## Pause



## Done

- [ ] Idea: MB train with Multiscale + uncertainity
