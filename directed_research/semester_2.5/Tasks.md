## Ideas

- [ ] Idea: UNet
- [ ] Idea: UNet with Multiscale
- [ ] Idea: Unet + Uncertainity
- [ ] Idea: UNet + multiscale + uncertainty
- [ ] Idea: Nanoflownet based MB impl


## Backlog

- [ ] Task: check if edge detection has been overfit by running tests
- [ ] print different loss components now
- [ ] Review: Focal Loss vs Detail Loss
- [ ] read nanoflownet again but this time for references
- [ ] some paper on consolidated methods for speed of the network
- [ ] Task: compare with same resolution with other papers


## Progress

- [ ] [[recalculate all the metrics computed for previous models]]
- [ ] [[Idea  Multiscale + Uncertainty + Motion Boundary]]
- [ ] warping module edge tpu compatible


## training



## Pause

- [ ] Task: warp and check<br>- [ ] plot the errors<br>- [x] plot artificial images and check
- [ ] Task: get 450 Epoch finetuned model from Aniket, Mandeep and Prof Nitin
- [ ] [[Task  review existing pretrained model on sintel to compare numbers with my script and paper]]<br>- [x] impl RAFT evaluation to make sure numbers are correct<br>- [ ] update presentation with numbers and images<br>- [ ] check difference between resize and crop again<br>- [ ] modify original code to make sure numbers for resize and crop are same as the previous


## Done

- [ ] Task: test the trained Multiscale + uncertainty+MB<br>[[Idea  Multiscale + Uncertainty + Motion Boundary]]
- [ ] Idea: MB train with Multiscale + uncertainity<br><br>[[Idea  Multiscale + Uncertainty + Motion Boundary]]
