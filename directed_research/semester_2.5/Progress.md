reviewing previous calls
goal should be to increase the speed and accuracy of the optical flow network. 

For tomorrow's meeting with him, 
- I want to go over some of the links that he shared
- let's start with implementing DCVNet 
- train the network based on the gradient of the flow and uncertainity
- 

what is happening in optical flow?
