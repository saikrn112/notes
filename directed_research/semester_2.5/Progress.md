reviewing previous calls
goal should be to increase the speed and accuracy of the optical flow network. 

For tomorrow's meeting with him, 
- I want to go over some of the links 
- let's start with implementing DCVNet 
- train the network based on the gradient of the flow and uncertainity

>[!ERROR] URGENT
go over previous numbers and make sure they are correct

## 2023.06.21

I need to calculate where we stand on Sintel dataset so that we can see how much to improve 
for that I need to know where my models are and which ones to focus on 
I need a consolidated list of models or star models in my research so far
