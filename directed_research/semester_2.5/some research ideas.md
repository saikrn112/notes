currently where am I at ? 
looking at the report
- i tried a bunch of things to speed up 
- I need to profile and see how many are edge quantizable? 
- need to make experiments that can run on those 

there are a bunch of ideas that I discussed with Nitin to train optical flow 
- edge boundary based training 
- something to do with obstacles? no
