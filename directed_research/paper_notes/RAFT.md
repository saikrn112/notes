Instead of coarse-to-fine refinements, RAFT  mimics an iterative optimization algorithm, and estimates flow through iterative updates of a high resolution flow field based on 4D correlation volumes constructed for all pairs of pixels from per-pixel features

(RAFT) [32] represents the state-of-the-art in optical flow estimation, where a high resolution flow field is refined through iterative updates, based on lookups from a 4D cost volume constructed between all pairs of pixels
