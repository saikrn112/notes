**Homomorphism**
a special correspondence between the members (elements) of two algebraic systems, such as two groups, two rings, or two fields

**Level Set**
of a real valued function $f$ of $n$ variables is a set where function takes on given constant value $c$  ^cdfb3a
$$
L_{c}(f) = {(x_1,x_2,...,x_n) \space | \space f(x_1,x_2,...,x_n) = c}
$$

example a contour of a hilly region
one cool thing to notice 
- going along level set doesnt change the function value
- hence perpendicular to the level set is where gradient is steepest
