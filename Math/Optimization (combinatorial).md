Assignment Problem - [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assignment_problem) ^a67c29

In graph theory sense, it is 
>The assignment problem consists of finding, in a [weighted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_graph "Weighted graph") [bipartite graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite_graph "Bipartite graph"), a [matching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matching_(graph_theory) "Matching (graph theory)") of a given size, in which the sum of weights of the edges is minimum.

>[!NOTE]
>Both edges and vertices can be weighted, not just edges like you have been primed
