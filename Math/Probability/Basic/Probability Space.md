[wiki - probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_space)

space or triplet $\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P$  gives formal model of random process or experiment
- $\Omega$ - sample space - set of all possible outcomes
- $\mathcal{F}$ - set of events - (event - a subset of outcomes)
- $P$ - a [[Set Function|set function]] which assigns each event  a probability (number between 0 to 1), 2 conditions though
	- probability of countable union of mutually exclusive events == sum of probability of mutually exclusive events
	- probability of $\Omega$ -  1
