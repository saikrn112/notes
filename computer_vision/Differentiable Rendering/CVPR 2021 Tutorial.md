Foward rendering
- rasterization
- ray tracing methods -- more in physics based rendering

### Ray Tracking
- ray surface intersection computations
- something about it being explicit -- mesh (where the ray is intersecting the triangle)
- vs implicit SDF based representations of the scene
	- implicit because we are parametrizing the scene into functions
- Used in path tracing , bidirectional path tracing etc

### Physics Based Forward Rendering
- Monte Carlo Integration

>[!question]
>how is integration coming into this? 

rendering equation is an integral equation
