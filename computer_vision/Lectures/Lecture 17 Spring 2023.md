Image and scene segmentation


color segmentation
- group similar pixels together

clustering

hard clustering 
- points are clustered to only 1 cluster

how is noise related to distance metric? 

super pixels 
- group of similar pixels

SLIC super pixels - Simple Linear Iterative Clustering 


##### Graph Terminology

degree
volume 
cut 

Segmentation by Graph Cuts 
- segments (cliques)
- mincut - kruskal's algorithm

##### Energy Minimization



##### Semantic segmentation
Instance + semantic == panoptic 

High Definition maps - dense maps 


##### Receptive field vs resolution

Dilated convolution


#### Networks

SegNet
