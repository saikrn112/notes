Lagrange multiplier  $\alpha$

zero - shot - never seen sample - generalization

association - what all co-occur
attention mechanism 
Vision transfomers - bag of visual words

self supervision for stereo - depth prediction on both images should be consistent

camera IMU time synchronization
software or hardware sync
hardware sync - global trigger pin every 100th imu measurement take a picture
