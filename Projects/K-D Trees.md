## Definition
Binary Tree in higher dimensions

Binary tree: splits using one value
KD Tree : splits at every step using different dimension of K dimensions

consequence: each node can have multiple data points unlike binary tree, so once we identify the node, we need to linear search or binary search on that 


## Uses
- Recognition, Classification - efficiently search large database 
- Tracking
- image enhancement - identify, remove noise or artifacts
- video summarization

>[!Question]
>how are the distance metrics implemented for use cases like face detection, feature descriptor etc? 

### Gotchas
how to chose the dimension to separate ? - high to low variance
how to chose the value to separate ?  - median
