usual optical flow - 5Px 100Hz
chunking sped up things
- same as resizing 
- biased EPE numbers if compared on same scale 

multiscaling gave more accuracy - 3px
trade secret
- uncertainity estimate (homoscedastic aleatoric) gave even better results
- drone dodging videos 
- static avoiding videos


tried a lot of things with respect to the network 
- ablation study of network
- smaller doesnt mean faster! 
- GMACs or parameters doesnt mean anything for robotics unless it truly fit well for the hardware
we dont need complicated network
