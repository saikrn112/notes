| Feature              | Breadth-First Search (BFS)                                                               | Depth-First Search (DFS)                                                                                |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Order of Exploration | Explores all nodes at the current depth before moving on to the next level               | Explores as far as possible along one branch before backtracking                                        |
| Data Structure       | Uses a queue                                                                             | Uses a stack or recursion                                                                               |
| Completeness         | Guaranteed to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph if one exists                | Does not necessarily find the shortest path                                                             |
| Memory Usage         | Generally requires more memory as all nodes at the current level are stored in the queue | Typically uses less memory as it only needs to store the current path                                   |
| Implementation       | Often implemented iteratively using a queue                                              | Can be implemented using recursion or a stack                                                           |
| Time Complexity      | O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges                  | O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges                                 |
| Use Cases            | Shortest path finding, web crawling, puzzle solving                                      | Topological sorting, solving mazes, pathfinding in artificial intelligence, detecting cycles in a graph |
