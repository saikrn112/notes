### 2023.06.05
only meetings
Discussed briefly with Yoni on how we can use points to get full pose
using something like PnP
I will check out ground truth generation now 


### 2023.06.06

- script which extracts frames and corresponding timestamps in sequence
- when I do rosbag replay I will pump it through synchronizer, subscribe and save -- easiest to do 
	- saver will create a csv with following fields
	- `frame_id, mk1_pose, mk2_pose, mk3_pose, cam_pose`
	- otherwise I need to something like Howard did 
		- save the images, sequences and their timestamps in csv
		- find time correspondences between images based on the lowest set of images
		- find time correspondences between ref image and wv data
		- save that as the above csv format

- get world viz information with only one marker
- hopefully one of the axis is aligning with the depth and get difference 
	- if not I need some transformation that makes it a difference (`T_map_to_align`)
- plot depth vs time for both ground truth and estimated

- get 6DoF pose from world viz markers 
- plot yaw vs time for both ground truth and estimated
