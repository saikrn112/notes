ideas: 
1. use semantic tags as place recognition modules 
2. can we use bars itself as semantic tags ? 
3. IMU as heuristic for depth from stereo or SavLoc
4. ToF sensor for depth integration
5. SAM for segmentation
6. https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.08712.pdf
7. using illuminator as a feature enhancer
8. intel MiDas as monocular depth estimation
9. using kalman filter to track how the depth and other estimates are varying
