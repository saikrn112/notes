upsampling and downsampling 
- optical flow images in flownet for example 

how is optical flow interpolated? [[Optical flow intricate details#^8b4152|link]]

what happens when we apply laplacian, gaussian, sobel to the image? 

what are some of the cameras used on drones? 
- and how does camera model change according to them

spatial transformer network 
how did we make differentiable DLT layer? 

phase correlation - feature matching if low resolution

rotation and translation from homography
inverse warp based on fundamental matrix $F$


disparity if 2 different focal lengths? 
- if two cameras have different resolution?

convolution transpose and convolution math
what about biases in conv operator - [[Biases]]
batch normalization
upconvolution

inverse transform sampling from NeRF


why PCA doesnt work
