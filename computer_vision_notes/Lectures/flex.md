### Question - 3
depth is from 1st frame

b. 
are they 2 images? or 2 pairs of images? 
should we assume the equation given in part a? 
that is we have known v_{t0} and w_{t0}?
do we know disparity? 
can we assume stereo camera is rectified? 
can we do feature matching for disparity?

depth from optical flow

c. 
identify common region
how to do that? 

how to solve for lambdas $IR$ and $RGB$ 
can I assume the camera centers as well?
