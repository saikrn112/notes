image morphing
global warp -- warp entire image

why is it called non parametric warp or local warp? 
every single pixels have different parameter to warp with, that's why it's called local warp

why triangles? 
smaller set to define plane
triangle correspondence problem -- 
what did he mean by consistent triangles? 


Gaussian mixture model -- fitting ellipsoid? 

Radial Basis Function - for interpolation -- kernel 

temporal smoothening?
