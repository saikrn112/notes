Localization Network
- takes feaure map as input
- gives parameters of affine tranformation that should be applied to that feature map

Grid Generator
- generates a grid of $(x,y)$ coordinates using the parameters of affine transformation given above
	- this transformation corresponds to a set of points where the input feature map should be sampled to produce transformed output feature map

Bilinear Sampler
- takes input feature map, grid generated by grid generator and produces output feature map using bilinear interpolation

how is this layer differentiable? 
how is it increasing geometric invariance? 
do we have to train this network?
