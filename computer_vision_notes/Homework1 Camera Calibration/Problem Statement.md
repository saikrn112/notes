>Note that the YY axis has odd number of squares and XX axis has even number of squares. It is a general practice to neglect the outer squares (the row and columns of squares on the edges of the checkerboard). For example, if you have a 5×8 grid, you’ll only consider the inner 3×63×6 grid for computation. **Again, this is not necessary but a common practice.**



parameters good initial estimate is used in the non linear optimizer 

how does radial distortion fit into the camera matrix $K$


maximum likelihood is being used as a nonlinear optimizer
