```
We are an interdisciplinary group of computer scientists and user experience experts working on novel IoT, robotics and autonomous systems.

-   In close collaboration with our business unit teams, you will be assisting with the analysis and optimization of the performance of ROS 2 for embedded systems.
-   You will learn about reliable and deterministic performance measurements of real-time systems using ros2_tracing.
-   Furthermore, you will create a repeatable test setup to examine distributed system performance under challenging network conditions.
-   You will also connect findings with real-world user and developer experience issues.
-   Last but not least, you will implement and trial improvements to the Open Source ROS 2 Framework to improve performance.
