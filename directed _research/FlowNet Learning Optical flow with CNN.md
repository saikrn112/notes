## Overview 
optical flow estimation problem as a supervised learning task
proposes and compares 2 architecture
1. generic architecture 
2. another one includesa layer that correlates feature vectors at different image locations
trained using generated synthetic flying chairs dataset
- generalizes well though -- sim 2 real
