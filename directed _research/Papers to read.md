Goal:
- fit the optical flow nets on TPS and other edge devices
- applications?
	- depth estimation - why cant we use monocular estimation for this?
	- motion segmentation
	- action recognition
	- video editing - ==how?==
	- autonomous driving

Problems:
An optical flow paper is marked complete if it address the following challenges  ^b83487
- Occlusion
- Large Displacement
- Temporal information
- Intensity variations?
- network should generalize well outside of it's training without fine tuning

To evaluate each Network, we need data which accounts the above problems as benchmarks

what exactly is intelligence in smaller drones? #nitin_sanket 
what was done so far? 
what needs to be done? 
- is obstacle avoidance the only usage of smaller drones?
