## Backlog

- [ ] FoV calculation with known box
- [ ] integrating segmentation with ToF PC
- [ ] hires calibration on STR1
- [ ] homography based yaw estimation
- [ ] how does drone compresss 4k to vga


## Progress

- [ ] verify the distance from ToF


## Pause

- [ ] [[Time of Flight]] ^0z3yh4
- [ ] vp_yaw estimation wrt ground truth bags<br>- [ ]  collect yaw + distance ground truth<br>- [ ]  run segmentation and the other pipeline


## Done

- [ ] consolidate conversation with Michael - 2023.07.05 starling dataset
- [ ] color images from graybar<br>- Mathew gave a script to download from MongoDB
- [ ] [[hires segmentation with current yolo]]


## archive

- [ ] graybar edges<br>- [ ] bag files for graybar - Yoni<br>- [ ] undistort and segment<br>- [ ] vp_yaw estimation
- [ ] check optical flow between stereo pair
- [ ] gray bar hires images - run vp_yaw estimation
