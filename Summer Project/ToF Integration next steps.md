- [ ] should I use depth_image_proc tools ?
	- [ ] see why camera_info computed is 0 ? 
		- [ ] check if depth image point cloud is good or not 
- [ ] if I can send the image instead of `tof_pc`
- [ ] compute cpu load [[compute cpu load metrics]]
	- [ ] if I am sending point_cloud computed by voxl
	- [ ] if I am sending tof_depth image instead + tof_camera_info
- [ ] compute network load 
	- [ ] if I am sending point_cloud computed by voxl
	- [ ] if I am sending tof_depth image instead + tof_camera_info
- [ ] collect bag files from tof irrespective of it in our usual path
- [ ] compare and run current savloc with the same bag files
	- [ ] also run my approach to see value in it 


what will be beneficial from resume point of view? 
Research on depth from stereo in textureless and repetitive scenes using classical computer vision
improved segmentation pipeline for yolov8 
Integrated tof + hires estimation and improved localization pipeline
improved their VPS by 100% 
streamlined their ground truth estimation using worldviz



if I can get some numbers showing improvement, that will be good 
what numbers? -- [[VPS metrics]]
if I can collect the starling data with flight, and run it through the pipeline and collect the depth vs yaw measurements
