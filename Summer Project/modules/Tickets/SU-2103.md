- is this is a blocker that new model training cannot proceed? 
- what is the protocol to merge dev variant to master? 
	- AC for moving to localization model training

account for offline training 


for training, 
- aeva data for training from scratch 
- multilane is not really required since the model is cropping
- when given access to other folders is it improving the performance of the LOE network 



- [x]  VDI setup 
- [x]  custom installations
