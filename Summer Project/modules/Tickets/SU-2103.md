- is this is a blocker that new model training cannot proceed? 
- what is the protocol to merge dev variant to master? 
	- AC for moving to localization model training

account for offline training 


for training, 
- aeva data for training from scratch 
- multilane is not really required since the model is cropping
- when given access to other folders is it improving the performance of the LOE network 



- [x]  VDI setup 
- [x]  custom installations 
- [x] download aeva data 
- [x] download requiments for running (sagemaker) 
- [x] developing
- [x] tensorboard integration
	- [x] validation 
- [x] histogram 
	- [ ] histogram clipping
- [ ] aeva + old data
- [ ] bag file and check 
- [ ] how are they using in localization (in action with code)


how is it finding the submodules 
	oh it is softlinked to localization folder 

- [ ] why is it called guidecam? 
- [ ] validation analysis 
	- [ ] imagesbad vs imagesgood
	- [ ] histogram
	- [ ] diff values
	- [ ] activation map

- [ ] what all does sagemaker dump in output_bucket
- [ ] how to make it use the local cached container
- [ ] can I name the sagemaker output with timestamp?
- [ ] when does it use model and when does it use output? 

- [x] add validation set in train script
	- [x] add corresponding tensorboard logs
	- [ ] this should work with sagemaker scripts 
- [ ] pack all the outputs and models well 
- [ ] accordingly need to change the test script
- [ ] check if I can get the validation loss below 10cm
- [ ] test it with aeva + old data
- [ ] modify the dataloader for dynamically loading the images 
- [ ] create a split + val dataset from train set
- [ ] know train+ val+ test split


---
next steps
- [x] serialize_model.py
	- [x] naming convention of the model 
		- [ ] `Offset_LL_RL_LO_RO_120_29_LIG301.pt`
		- [ ] meaning of the naming convention
	
- [ ] train index right and left (right_dominant == True IndexRight)
- [x] https://github.com/torc-robotics/lidar_lane_offset_estimator/tree/development
- [x] run the test on the recorded bag file (compare against map localizer) and get consensus metrics

----
- [x] list of topics
- [x] https://github.com/torc-robotics/deployment_gen2.3/blob/main/versions.yaml

- [ ] why deep learning for this? 
	- [ ] this method came before 
- [ ] why cant classical method do the job? 
- [ ] is it measuring lane offset from left adjacent lane or right adjacent lane?

--- 
what all do I need for finalizing the output? 
- [ ] some work at data loader using balancing
	- [ ] related performance comparison
	- [ ] checkout if SMTOE thing that saurabh shared works
- [ ] lane index estimator training 
- [ ] qualitative check between old and new one
	- [ ] which one is lane offset? 
	- [ ] echo ros topic 
	- [ ] is lane offset estimator even running?
		- [ ] check rqt node graph
	- [ ] update the LOE branch with models
- [ ] quantitative check 
	- [ ] avg LOE error for 3 different bags
	- [ ]

- [x] blue box 
- [x] green dots - where the truck
- [x] sky blue dots 
- [x] light blue dots
brightness of blue dots is score? 
	particle score of confidence
- [x] yellow line  - path so far
- [x] red dots - GNSS + IMU global location (gaussian distribution around this)
- [x] purple pluses  -- landmarks
- [x] purple dots - part of PDF higher score of green dots

- [x] is it purely based off LIG output? 
- [x] encoder - wheel speeds 

![[grayish_road.png]]
darker patches - no lidar data 
raster map and real time lidar image is overlayed on top


![[map_broadcaster.png]]

- [ ] grid_map
- [ ] semantic_map 
- [ ] map_traffic_signals


- [x] what do they mean by consensus metrics? 
- [x] record both 
	- [x] /map_localizer/map_lane_offset 
	- [x] /semantic_map_localizer/lane_position
- [ ] get csvs
	- [ ] plot historgram of errors 
	- [ ] 

plot of lane offsets 
histogram comparison between both 

AC: 
- comparison of consensus metrics between both map_localizer/map_lane_offset and semantic_map_localizer/lane_position
- same with the new model


----

- [x] roscore
- [x] dockers up 
- [x] rviz up
- [x] rqt up
- [x] make sure lane_correlator is connected with everything else 
- [x] play the rosbag
	- [x] exclude certain topics 
- [x] make sure by echoing the above topics
	- [x] install localization related topic for echo
	- [x] also make sure they are not getting echoed from bag file itself
- [ ] record the topics 
- [ ] plot the topics 
- [ ] comparision against the previously predicted values
