```
The model we are working on is predicting lane lines and drivable surface boundary
Ans its doing it end-to-end in BEV space not in Image space
Will be consumed by World modelling and the localization team
```


High Level Questions:
- [ ] if they are still developing shared architecutre, why are we modifying it already without baselines? 
- [ ] documentation of new architecture is dependent on baseline architecutre that other team is developing
- [ ] is there any preferred style of the model documentation? examples that I can refer to 


- [ ] validation loss for entire val dataset vs only few mini batches?



vectorized map


vectorize map elements using data from onboard sensors
map elements
```
road boundaries 
lane dividers 
pedestrian crossings
```

polyline representation

hierarchial representation to identify and reprsent map elements using BEV feature maps
using `element` and `keypoint` queries 

element queries - object queries - map queries 


```
nn.init.xavier_uniform_
```


```python
# project feat from 2D to bev plane
projected_feature = F.grid_sample(
	cam_feat, bev_grid_pos).view(self.B, -1, C, nlvl, bH, bW)  # B,cam,C,nlvl,bH,bW

```

teacher force strategy
in format_det
`det_label`
`keypoint`
