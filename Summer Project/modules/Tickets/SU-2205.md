```
The model we are working on is predicting lane lines and drivable surface boundary
Ans its doing it end-to-end in BEV space not in Image space
Will be consumed by World modelling and the localization team
```


High Level Questions:
- [ ] if they are still developing shared architecutre, why are we modifying it already without baselines? 
- [ ] documentation of new architecture is dependent on baseline architecutre that other team is developing
- [ ] is there any preferred style of the model documentation? examples that I can refer to 


- [ ] validation loss for entire val dataset vs only few mini batches?
