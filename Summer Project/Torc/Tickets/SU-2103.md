- is this is a blocker that new model training cannot proceed? 
- what is the protocol to merge dev variant to master? 
	- AC for moving to localization model training

account for offline training 


for training, 
- aeva data for training from scratch 
- multilane is not really required since the model is cropping
- when given access to other folders is it improving the performance of the LOE network 


pull data to the VDI for developing
- VDI setup 
- custom installations 
- download aeva data 
- download requiments for running (sagemaker) 
- developing
