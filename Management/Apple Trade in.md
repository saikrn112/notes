    You are connected with Fiona.
    
- Agent's Message:Hey, there!
    
- Agent's Message:How may I help you today?
    
- Your Message:Hi Fiona
    
- Agent's Message:Hi!
    
- Your Message:I want to trade in my current macbook with m2 air
    
- Your Message:I already chose the specs and everything
    
- Agent's Message:I'd be here to assist you regarding trading in of your MacBook towards MacBook Air.
    
- Your Message:with the help of another specialist.
    
- Your Message:I wanted to know how the trade in works
    
- Agent's Message:That's a good question!
    
- Agent's Message:Here’s how the trade in works:
    
- Agent's Message:If you pay monthly, we’ll apply the trade-in value as an instant credit to lower your monthly payments.
    
- Agent's Message:While, if you pay in full, we’ll credit your original payment method after we receive and assess your trade-in device.
    
- Agent's Message:The trade-in value would depend on your MacBook's condition and it will undergo assessment and you will be receiving an email regarding the final trade-in value that you can choose to accept or reject.
    
- Agent's Message:Once you have placed your order with a trade-in, the trade-in-kit will be shipped within 2-3 business days of your new product shipping or being ready for pickup in-store.
    
- Agent's Message:You then prepare and ship your device within 14 days of receiving the trade-in kit.
    
- Agent's Message:The trade-in device is received and assessed to verify its condition by our trade-in partner.
    
- Agent's Message:When the device passes inspection, Apple processes your refund to the original payment method within 5 business days.
    
- Agent's Message:In case the device does not pass inspection, you will be emailed a revised trade-in value that you can choose to accept or reject.
    
- Agent's Message:Generally it takes 2–3 weeks.
    
- Agent's Message:But the sooner you send us your device, the sooner we can verify its condition and process your credit or gift card.
    
- Your Message:so this is what I have in mind.
    
- Your Message:I want to pick up new mac from the store
    
- Your Message:but I wont be having my current mac with me then
    
- Your Message:so can I go some other time to the store for trade in?
    
- Agent's Message:Definitely!
    
- Agent's Message:You can just pick up your order and bring the trade-in device anytime.
    
- Agent's Message:As long as it is within 14 days from the date you picked up your new MacBook.
    
- Agent's Message:So you will have ample time to back up and transfer your datas from the old MacBook to the new one.
    
- Your Message:can I bring the trade in device at any apple store or only where I picked up?
    
- Agent's Message:For that, you can only bring the trade-in device from the Apple Store where you picked up your order.
    
- Agent's Message:It should be the same Apple Store.
    
- Your Message:ok, I am moving back to another city sometime in the future. so is it not possible to trade in that city?
    
- Agent's Message:I'm sorry, the trade-in policy is to bring the device on the same Store.
    
- Agent's Message:If you would like, you can choose send trade-in device via mail on the checkout of your order.
    
- Agent's Message:You will be sent a trade-in kit.
    
- Your Message:is this with the kit that you mentioned?
    
- Agent's Message:Yes, it is.
    
- Agent's Message:The 14 days will start on the day you received your trade-in kit.
    
- Your Message:I see
    
- Your Message:will there be additional mailing charges if I send it via trade in kit?
    
- Agent's Message:No worries, it is free of charge.
    
- Agent's Message:And Apple closely monitors the shipment of your trade-in device.
    
- Your Message:I see
    
- Your Message:and I might need assistance in transferring the data from old macbook to new macbook. I thought this might be easier with store trade-in
    
- Agent's Message:Yes, that's the advantage of trading in store.
    
- Agent's Message:The Specialist at the Genius Bar will help you on transferring your datas.
    
- Agent's Message:While via mail, the datas should be all wiped out before sending the trade-in device.
    
- Your Message:I see
    
- Agent's Message:Just a heads up, once you choose the option to send the trade-in via mail, it cannot be changed to in-store.
    
- Your Message:and should the device be delivered within 14 days?
    
- Agent's Message:May I know if you are referring to the new MacBook?
    
- Your Message:I meant the trade in kit
    
- Agent's Message:Yes, the trade-in device should be sent to our warehouse 14 days from the time you received the trade-in kit.
    
- Your Message:ok, got it
    
- Agent's Message:Once your order ships, the trade-in kit will be shipped within 2 to 3 business days.
    
- Agent's Message:Do you want to complete the purchase now while I’m here?
    
- Agent's Message:I can definitely stay on the line to make sure that everything will be smooth on your purchase.
    
- Your Message:can I change to trade-in kit at the store if I dont have the device with me ?
    
- Agent's Message:Just to clarify, you already placed the order and the trade-in is in-store?
    
- Your Message:I currently chose trade-in as in-store but 1 step away from placing the order
    
- Agent's Message:Yes, you can inform the Specialist at the store that you would like to change the trade-in via mail if ever you don't have the trade-in device with you.
    
- Your Message:great
    
- Agent's Message:They can change the trade-in fulfillment on their end.
    
- Your Message:ok makes sense.
    
- Agent's Message:For your future reference once you checked out, you will receive email for order confirmation shortly and will receive another email/text message when your order ships or ready for pick up.
    
- Agent's Message:You can also track your most up-to-date order details through [Order Status](https://www.apple.com/orderstatus).
    
- Agent's Message:Once your product ships, you will receive an email invitation with a link to schedule your free Personal Setup session.
    
- Agent's Message:I want to make sure all your concerns are addressed to, so will there be anything else I can help you with or look into for you?
    
- Your Message:no, this is great info.
    
- Your Message:is there any way for me to save this conversation for future reference?
    
- Agent's Message:There is an option to download the transcript after the end of the chat.
