whole grain less processed food 


food planning? 
how to do it ? 
where to start from? 
too many resources to checkout
lot of posts in instagram 
have some earlier resources 
too many cusinies to try out from 


criteria 
- should resolve my needs for micro and macro nutrients 
- can contain egg but dont want to rely on it 
- dont mind taking protien powder 
- most important should be easy to make not more than 20-30mins
- I dont like meal planning, it is annoying
- need to keep my calories in check


what are the main blockers? 
- lack of time
- ingredients
- utensils 

if the recipe has science behind it, that makes it even more interesting and easy for me to mix and match

## Why did I fail last few times?

I tried dieting at least twice so far, once in 2019ish and another time again in 2021ish

1. meal planning was hard to keep up with lazy ass 
2. portion control was also hard 
3. food was not interesting to follow
