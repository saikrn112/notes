10 weeks


plan for 10 weeks 
DfS

depth from voxel 2
- time of flight

compare 
something to do with yaw
camera intrinsics 
and extrinsics 

qvio
savloc
fidloc

----


	repeating texture can have a bad stereo matching results




- [ ] need to update the confluence for weekly report kinda thing
- [ ] need to check howard as to what else is there in savloc improvement


what is happening right now? 
so I am getting depth by assuming some initial estimate. 
I need a metric to actually compare the depth I am getting
thing is, I am getting for points 
how do I compare the depth for points? 
and I also need to check how tolerant this algorithm is. 
as in if the inital depth is off by a few cms
