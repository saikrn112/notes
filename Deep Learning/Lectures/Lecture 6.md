last class what about softmax regression - which is a classification

how is bias term visualized? 


##### XOR problem
linear NN cannot inherently learn the XOR problem


##### Activation functions
[[Activation Functions|here]]
activations can be cross connected with inputs
how to decide when to use which? 
- cultural - as in best practices 
- if we want to enforce how the hidden layer activations should look like

why ReLU works better for XOR problem? 
	because of nonlinearity




without non linearity any N - layer NN collapses to a 2 layer NN

depth vs width

##### Chain rule - Differentiating XOR problem
