why fully connected layer in CNN? 





bayesian optimization in reinforcement learning?


Pooling - is necessary 
1. network training computationally feasible 
2. more fundamentally, it allows aggregation of information over large areas of input images
drawbacks:
- reduces resolution 
> I thought it's aiding in network training because it reduces resolution, is that not why it is making training feasible?  ^bcb9ce
