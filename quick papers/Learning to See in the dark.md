New dataset 
- raw short exposure low light images
- corresponding long expsoure high quality reference images
what is "raw" here? 

less than 0.1 lux of illumination 
lux - lumens/second or watt/m2

denoising - remove noise
burst of images - burst alignment algorithms
demosaicing - is it debayring? yup!
